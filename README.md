# Girly 1.0 - Your Personal Safety Companion

## Project Overview

Girly 1.0 is a robust, proactive women's safety application designed to provide a real-time security system using a blend of advanced AI, IoT, and cloud computing. The application is built to empower women and ensure their safety in various emergency situations by offering multiple innovative features for personal security. This project is currently in the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage and we are seeking collaborators to help us build a full-featured, production-ready application.

## Key Features (MVP)

The current version of Girly 1.0 includes the following core functionalities:

1.  **Motion Sensor-based SOS:**
    * Trigger an emergency alert by simply shaking the mobile phone 2-3 times.
    * This action automatically initiates an emergency call, sends alerts to pre-configured guardians and authorities, and begins live voice recording for evidence.

2.  **Smartwatch Integration:**
    * Enhances security when the phone is not accessible.
    * Utilizes a machine learning model to monitor heart rate fluctuations. An abnormal spike or drop can automatically trigger an SOS alert.

3.  **Real-time Threat Alerts:**
    * Leverages predictive analytics based on historical crime data to provide real-time warnings about potentially dangerous areas.
    * Uses GPS tracking to notify users about high-risk zones before they enter them.

4.  **Intruder Detection:**
    * Scans for unauthorized or suspicious mobile devices and networks within a 5-10 meter radius.
    * Alerts the user if a potential threat is detected nearby, enhancing personal privacy and security.

5.  **Complaint Management System:**
    * A seamless system for users to report incidents directly.
    * Users can track the progress of their case and communicate with authorities through the app.

6.  **Secure Data Storage:**
    * All emergency voice recordings and user data are securely stored in Firebase Cloud Storage.
    * Data can be securely accessed by law enforcement with proper authorization.

## Technology Stack

* **Platform:** Android (Kotlin)
* **Backend:** Firebase (Authentication, Realtime Database, Cloud Storage)
* **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow Lite for on-device models (Motion Sensor & Heart Rate Anomaly Detection)
* **UI/UX:** Material Design, ConstraintLayout

## How to Contribute

We are a small team and this project is open-source. We would love to get help from the developer community to turn this MVP into a powerful and reliable safety tool.

You can contribute in the following areas:

* **Code Review & Bug Fixes:** Help us identify and fix bugs in the existing code.
* **Feature Development:** Implement new features like the Community Tab, Rescue Map, or further enhance the existing ones.
* **AI/ML Model Improvement:** Help improve the accuracy of our TensorFlow Lite models to reduce false positives.
* **UI/UX Design:** Suggest and implement improvements to the user interface and overall user experience.
* **Documentation:** Help write and improve the project's documentation.
